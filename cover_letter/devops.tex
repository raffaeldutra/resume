\begin{itemize}

\item Monitoring and Logging: I have experience setting up monitoring and logging solutions using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, and Splunk to proactively identify and resolve issues, ensuring high system availability.

\item Containerization and Orchestration: I am proficient in containerization technologies such as Docker and container orchestration tools like Kubernetes. I have deployed and managed containerized applications in production environments, optimizing resource utilization and scalability.

\item Infrastructure as Code (IaC): I am skilled in using infrastructure as code tools like Terraform and AWS CloudFormation to create, provision, and manage infrastructure resources. This approach ensures consistency and repeatability in infrastructure deployments.

\item Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): I have successfully implemented CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitLab, Github and Bamboo to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. This has significantly reduced development cycle times and improved code quality.

\item Scripting and Automation: Proficient in scripting languages such as Python and Shell Script, I have automated repetitive tasks, reducing manual intervention and minimizing errors.
